//! 
//! Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD, also called Biological Oxygen Demand) is the amount of dissolved oxygen needed (i.e. demanded) 
//! by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period. 
//! The BOD value is most commonly expressed in milligrams of oxygen consumed per litre of sample during 5 days of incubation at 20 Â°C and is often used as a surrogate of the degree of organic pollution of water.[1]
//! BOD can be used as a gauge of the effectiveness of wastewater treatment plants. BOD is similar in function to chemical oxygen demand (COD), in that both measure the amount of organic compounds in water.
//! However, COD is less specific, since it measures everything that can be chemically oxidized, rather than just levels of biodegradable organic matter.
